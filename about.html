                    <h3>Asoluka Charles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Asoluka Charles founded the <strong>HAVE IT ALIVE FOUNDATION</strong> from a deeply personal place. Having grown up in an underserved community, he witnessed firsthand how easily potential can be extinguished by a lack of resources and opportunity. His life's mission became to create a support system that doesn't just provide aid, but actively works to keep the "it"—the hope, the dreams, the spark of life—alive in every individual we help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a background in community development and a heart for service, Alex channeled his experiences into a foundation built on empathy, resilience, and direct action.

            <h2>Our Journey and Its Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                The road to making a difference is never easy. In our early days, our passion often outpaced our resources. We faced significant challenges that tested our resolve but ultimately strengthened our mission.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Scarcity:</strong> We started with little more than a vision, struggling to secure funding, find volunteers, and gather necessary supplies.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Trust:</strong> Gaining the trust of communities that have been let down time and again was a slow, delicate process that required consistency and genuine care.</li>
                <li><strong>Logistical Hurdles:</strong> Reaching remote and isolated individuals meant overcoming complex logistical nightmares, from transportation to communication barriers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These struggles taught us to be more innovative, resourceful, and deeply grateful for every bit of help we receive. They are a core part of our story and a reminder of why this work is so vital.
            </p>

        <section id="gratitude">
            <h2>A Heartfelt Thank You</h2>
            <p>
                None of our work would be possible without you. To every person who has donated, volunteered their time, shared our story, or simply offered a word of encouragement—we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your support is the fuel that allows us to overcome challenges and continue our mission. You are the reason we can keep hope alive for so many. You are a part of this foundation, and together, we are making a tangible difference in the world.
